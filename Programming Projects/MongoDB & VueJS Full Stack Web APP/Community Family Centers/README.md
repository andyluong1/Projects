<h1> Step by Step Guide </h1>
<br>Our team will be working with Community Family Centers.</br>
<p>The database holds 2 collections: Clients and Programs. The Clients collection store information on new clients. The Programs collection store a records of activites that each clients are participating in. Our application will allow the user to perform simple CRUD operations when interacting with the database. As well as, retrieve a activity that is associated with a client. The database stores all client information and activites that the clients are participating in. The webpage can also display records that the user can use for their business cases.</p>

<br><h2>Required programs and modules: </h2>
<li>dotenv
<li>express
<li>mongodb
<li>mongoose
<li>uuid
<li>OPTIONAL: Postman and Mongodb Compass
</li></br>


<h2>File Information: </h2>
<li>models -  This folder contains 2 schemas: clients and programs. Clients schema is also know as the Intake Form.</li>
<li>.gitignore -  This file will ignore the .env and node_module files.</li>
<li>app.js - This is the main file that stores CRUD functions and connection strings.</li>
<li>FinalProgrect.mongodb - This file stores the code that we used to create the database, the collections and the intial testing code for entering each field entry into their respective collection table.</li>
<li>Project 4339.postman_collection.json -  This is the exported file from our Postman API. Use this as file to run CRUD operations.</li>
<li>package-lock.json - This file holds the node modules.</li>
<li>package.json - This file has the dependencies used for this project.</li>

<br><h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<ol><li> Make sure to have the required programs installed.
<li> Start up the application by opening the terminal and type [ node app.js ] into the terminal. Restart the app anytime if needed. 
<li> Now that [ node app.js ] is running, open Postman and Mongodb Compass.
<li> Use the [ Project 4339.postman_collection.json ] to test the api, feel free to change the data but remeber to follow the data model as provided in the models folder. When using a Request that requires Client or Program ID, use the ID generated by Postman.
    <br><br> OR </br></br>
<li> Set up the api yourself in Postman by following the instructions below.
<li>For clients.js:
<ul><li>CREATE a client by [ POST ] and the url [ http://localhost:3000/client ] and select 'Body' >> 'raw' >> 'JSON'. Follow this templete and enter it into the Body. </li></ul></br>
