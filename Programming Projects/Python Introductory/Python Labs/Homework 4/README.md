For homework 4, it contains Zylabs 12.7, 12.9, 14.11, and 14.13. 

They contain code about handling exceptions, as well as searching and sorting algorithms. Zylabs 12.7 and 12.9 were straightforward, but I had trouble with 14.11.
I used the code provided in chapter 14, but I was still unable to solve the problem. 
For 14.13, I also used the algorithm code in the book and was able to solve the problem.
